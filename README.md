# About Me ðŸš€
Hello, I'm Victor, a full-stack web developer and crypto and NFT enthusiast. I excel in crafting robust websites using JavaScript, React and Node.js After dark, I delve into the thrilling realm of crypto markets, mining digital gems. Most of my groundbreaking work, the masterpieces of my coding portfolio, is securely tucked away in private repositories, mirroring the mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. 

Just imagine the unseen innovations! In the realm of code and crypto, there's always an adventure awaiting.

# My Invisible Work ðŸ‘»
The repo count you see on my GitHub profile is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that seemingly calm surface lies a wild, raging sea of private repos. If you're trying to calculate their numbers, you might run out of memory before you get to the correct figure. (Here's a fun fact: there are more private repos in my account than the total number of bugs in an early-stage JavaScript project, and trust me, that's saying something!)

# How to Contact Me ðŸ“«
If you're a friend who just wants to say hi, a recruiter with a position you think I might be interested in, or even a skilled hacker trying to access my private repos (nice try, better luck next time), feel free to reach out!

The best way to get in touch with me is through email. My inbox is always open, and I strive to reply promptly. You can email me at: v.huang435@gmail.com

I'm always open for a friendly chat, exciting opportunities!
